# v0.13 Release notes

The notes below cover all changes since **v0.11**. The items that were first published in v0.12 are repeated here, so that this list is complete for users upgrading directly from v0.11.

## pico-bootLoader

- This emulator can now be used with the new [pico-bootLoader](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-bootLoader). The bootloader lets you keep several emulators, and a *Doom* port, on one board and choose which one to start from an on-screen menu at power-on. Switching between them no longer requires a computer.
- The bootloader and an SD card archive containing this emulator are available on the [pico-bootLoader releases page](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-bootLoader/releases). Installation is described in the readme of that project.
- When the emulator is started from the bootloader, the settings menu contains an extra item, **Return to emulator selection**, to return to the boot menu.
- The binaries listed at the end of this page are standalone versions and are installed via BOOTSEL as before. To build a bootloader version yourself, add `-DBUILD_FOR_BOOTLOADER=ON` to the cmake command line, or use `./bld.sh -2 -c <HW_CONFIG> -b`.

## Video and HDMI

- For the boards that use HSTX instead of PicoDVI, HDMI audio is supported via the HSTX video driver. Thanks to [@fliperama86](https://github.com/fliperama86) for the [pico_hdmi](https://github.com/fliperama86/pico_hdmi) driver that made this possible and for helping out.
  - Adafruit Fruit Jam.
  - Murmulator M2.
- Other RP2350 configurations that use HSTX (GPIO 12 - 19) instead of PicoDVI:
  - [Breadboard](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus?tab=readme-ov-file#raspberry-pi-pico-or-pico-2-setup-with-adafruit-hardware-and-breadboard)
  - [PCB](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus?tab=readme-ov-file#pcb-with-raspberry-pi-pico-or-pico-2)
  - [Adafruit Metro RP2350](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus?tab=readme-ov-file#adafruit-metro-rp2350)

  All the other boards still use PicoDVI. To enable audio over HDMI, make sure external audio is disabled in the settings menu.
- HDMI audio on HSTX boards is more reliable: audio dropouts are resolved and more TVs and AV receivers are accepted.
- Fixed dots and dotted lines that could appear in the picture on some HDMI monitors.
- New **Display Mode** setting on HSTX boards, to choose between HDMI and DVI output. DVI has slightly lower latency but carries no audio.

## Settings menu

- New layout, with a SAVE / CANCEL / DEFAULT row and a scrollable list of options.
- The scanlines on/off option has been replaced by **Screen Mode**, which offers 1:1 with and without scanlines.
- New **Scanline Type** option on HSTX boards: *Simple* or *LCD*.
- New **Controller Test** screen. It shows a gamepad on screen that follows the controller you last pressed a button on, and lists the connected controllers. This makes it possible to check wiring and button mappings without starting a game. Hold SELECT+START for 2 seconds to leave the screen.
- Added an option to enter BOOTSEL mode for flashing firmware.
- Added an option to return to the boot menu when the emulator was started from the bootloader.
- The game list now starts in the `/roms/MD` folder instead of the root of the SD card. When that folder does not exist, the root folder is used. Placing your ROMs in `/roms/MD` is the recommended layout.
- When leaving a subfolder, that folder stays selected in the list instead of returning to the top.
- Settings are saved correctly when a game is reset, and settings changed with in-game button combinations are saved when returning to the menu.
- The software version is shown on the splash screen.
- Note: the format of the settings file has changed. Existing settings in `/settings_md.dat` are reset to their default values the first time this version starts.

## Controllers

- Retro-bit Mega Drive Arcade pad: the X, Y, Z, L and R buttons now work.
- DualShock 4 / DualSense: the L2 and R2 triggers now act as L and R.
- PlayStation Classic controller: the Square button now works.
- Wii Classic controller: the L and R shoulder buttons now work, as do ZL and ZR.
- SNES controllers can now be used on the controller port of the PCB and breadboard setups. NES controllers keep working as before and are recognised automatically.
- USB keyboard: added V, Q and W.
- Fruit Jam: fixed the sound chip failing to start when an SNES Classic Mini controller is connected at power-on. That controller can now also be used from the moment the menu appears.

## Games

- Games developed with [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK), such as *Xeno Crisis*, now start and are playable. Sound effects in these games are still missing. [#11](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-genesisPlus/issues/11)
- Starting a second game without switching the board off in between no longer leaves data of the previous game behind.

## Other

- More stable SD card access.
- Several stability fixes in the menu and the video output.

# v0.12 Release notes

For the boards that use HSTX in stead of PicoDVI: HDMI audio is now supported via the new HSTX video driver. Huge thanks to [@fliperama86](https://github.com/fliperama86) for the awesome [pico_hdmi](https://github.com/fliperama86/pico_hdmi) driver that made this possible and for helping out.

- Adafruit Fruit Jam.
- Murmulator M2. 

Other RP2350 configurations that now use HSTX (GPIO 12 - 19) in stead of PicoDVI:

- [Breadboard](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus?tab=readme-ov-file#raspberry-pi-pico-or-pico-2-setup-with-adafruit-hardware-and-breadboard)
- [PCB](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus?tab=readme-ov-file#pcb-with-raspberry-pi-pico-or-pico-2)
- [Adafruit Metro RP2350](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus?tab=readme-ov-file#adafruit-metro-rp2350)
  
All the other boards still use PicoDVI.

To enable audio over hdmi, make sure external audio is disabled in the settings menu.

- Added option in settings menu to enter bootsel mode for flashing firmware. 
- Partially fixed: Games developed with SGDK (like XenoCrisis) are now playable. However soundeffects are missing. [#11](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-genesisPlus/issues/11)

# v0.11 Release notes

- Added support for [Murmulator M1 and M2 boards](https://murmulator.ru). [@javavi](https://github.com/javavi)  [#150](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/issues/150)
  - M1: RP2040/RP2350
  - M2: RP2350 only
  **Note**: These Murmulator M1 and M2 builds are untested. Please report any issues.
- **Fruit Jam only**: Add volume controls to settings menu. Can also be changed in-game via (START + LEFT/RIGHT). Note that too high volume levels may cause distortion. (Ext speaker, advised 16 db max, internal advised 18 dB max). Latest metadata package includes a sample.wav file to test the volume level.
- Updated GenesisPlusMetaData.zip: Added **sample.wav**. This sample will be played when using the Fruit Jam volume control in the settings menu. Note when **/soundrecorder.wav** is found, this file will be played in stead.
- Updated the menu to also list .wav audio files.
- Added basic wav audio playback from within the menu. Press BUTTON2 or START to play the wav file. Tested with https://lonepeakmusic.itch.io/retro-midi-music-pack-1 The wav file must have the following specs:
  - 16/24 bit PCM wav files only.  (24 bit files are downsampled to 16 bit) 
  - 2ch stereo only.
  - Sample rate supported: 44100.
- **RP2350 with PSRAM only**: Record about 30 seconds of audio by pressing START to pause the game and then START + BUTTON1. Audio is recorded to **/soundrecorder.wav** on the SD-card.

>[!NOTE]
> Currently wav playback is too fast. 

## Fixes

- Fruit Jam audio fixes.
- Settings changed by in-game button combos are saved when exiting to menu.

# v0.10 Release notes

## Features

- Settings are saved to /settings_md.dat instead of /settings.dat. This allows to have separate settings files for different emulators (e.g. pico-infonesPlus and pico-peanutGB etc.).
- Added a settings menu.
  - Main menu: press SELECT to open; adjust options without using in-game button combos.
  - In-game: press SELECT+START to open; from here you can also quit from the game.
- Switched to Fatfs R0.16.

## Fixes
- Improved FPS limiter: now uses a fixed timestep approach and initializes timing at the start of emulation, ensuring stable frame rate from the first frame and correct behavior when emulator is overloaded.
- Fruit Jam: Check VU-Meter toggle only once per frame in stead of multiple times per frame.
- Fruit Jam: In game SELECT + RIGHT to toggle VU-Meter now works properly. 
- Show correct buttonlabels in menus.
- removed wrappers for f_chdir en f_cwd, fixed in Fatfs R0.16. (there was a long standing issue with f_chdir and f_cwd not working with exFAT formatted SD cards.)

# v0.9 release notes

## Features
- Fruit Jam: overclock speed set to 378Mhz (was 340 Mhz)
- When (S)NES classic controller is connected, a W is shown next to the flash/PSRAM size

## Fixes

- Fixed not properly working SNES Classic/WII Pro I2C controller. (NES Classic I2C always worked fine). 
- Fruit Jam: Initialisation of (S)NES classic/WII Pro I2C controller will now take place after DAC is initialized. [#4](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-genesisPlus/issues/10). You need to plug-in the controller **after** the intro screen is shown. In case the controller is connected and the DAC fails to initialize, an error screen is shown.

# v0.8 release notes

- Game pad fixes for Genesis style USB controllers. See README.

# v0.7 release notes

- Added support for [Retro-Bit Genesis/Megadrive 8 button Arcade Pad with USB](https://www.retro-bit.com/controllers/genesis/#usb).
- Settings:
  - Version number added. When the version in settings.dat does not match, settings will be reset to defaults.

# v0.6 release notes

## Features

- Audio works now [#3](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-genesisPlus/issues/3), although quality is not good. You can toggle audio on/off with SELECT + RIGHT on the controller. This increases the emulation speed a bit.
- Metadata support added. Download the [metadata]((https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-genesisPlus/releases/latest/download/GenesisPlusMetadata.zip)) from the releases below and extract the zip file to the root of your SD card. This adds game titles and box art to the menu. The screensaver also uses box art images.
- Support for [Adafruit Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6200). This version keeps the monitor at a 60 Hz refresh rate and should work on every monitor. The Fruit Jam has a built-in speaker and a NeoPixel LED strip that can be used as a VU meter.
- [Pimoroni Pico Plus 2](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-plus-2?variant=42092668289107) support added.
- When PSRAM is available, roms are loaded from SD card to PSRAM instead of flash. This speads the loading time up a lot.
- Uses Pico SDK 2.2.0

## Fixes

- When SD card is prepared on MacOs, the additional metadata files created by MacOs caused several issues. This is fixed now. (Hopefully, because I cannot test this myself) 
- several small fixes and improvements.

# v0.5 release notes (this is a re-release)

- Releases now built with SDK 2.1.1
- Support added for Adafruit Metro RP2350 board. See README for more info. No RISCV support yet.
- Switched to SD card driver pico_fatfs from https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs. This is required for the Adafruit Metro RP2350. Thanks to [elehobica](https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs) for helping making it work for the Pimoroni Pico DV Demo board.
- Besides FAT32, SD cards can now also be formatted as exFAT.
- Nes controller PIO code updated by [@ManCloud](https://github.com/ManCloud). This fixes the NES controller issues on the Waveshare RP2040 - PiZero board. [#8](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico_shared/issues/8)

- Switched to SD card driver pico_fatfs https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs. This is required for the Adafruit Metro RP2350. The Pimoroni Pico DV does not work with this updated version and still needs the old version. (see [https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs/issues/7#issuecomment-2817953143](https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs/issues/7#issuecomment-2817953143) ) Therefore, the old version is still included in the repository. (pico_shared/drivers/pio_fatfs) 
    This is configured in CMakeLists.txt file by setting USE_OLD_SDDRIVER to 1.
- Besides FAT32, SD cards can now also be formatted as exFAT.
- Nes controller PIO code updated by [@ManCloud](https://github.com/ManCloud). This fixes the NES controller issues on the Waveshare RP2040 - PiZero board. [#8](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico_shared/issues/8)
