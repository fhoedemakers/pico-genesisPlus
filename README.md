# Pico Genesis Plus

A Sega Genesis/Mega Drive emulator for the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (0RP2350). Reads roms from SD-card, uses hdmi for display.

Sound currently nog working. Help wanted.

Based on [Gwenesis](https://github.com/bzhxx/gwenesis)

Due to the flash size of the Raspberry Pi pico 2, 4MB roms cannot be loaded. Also not every game is guaranteed to work.

## Setup

[The emulator is based on Pico-InfonesPlus. Please refer to that repository for how to setup.](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus)
