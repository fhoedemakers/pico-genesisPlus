# CHANGELOG

# General Info

Binaries for each configuration and PCB design are at the end of this page. 4MB roms will not load because of the Pico 2 flash size. The menu will not show roms too large for the Pico 2.

Only RP2350 supported.

For the latest two player PCB 2.0, you need:

- Top_v2.0_with_Bootsel_Button.stl. This allows for software upgrades without removing the cover. (*)
- Base_v2.0.stl
- Power_Switch.stl.

(*) in case you don't want to access the bootsel button on the Pico, you can choose Top_v2.0.stl
