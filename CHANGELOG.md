# v0.6 release notes

## Features

- Audio works now, although quality is not good. You can toggle audio on/off with SELECT + RIGHT on the controller. This increases the emulation speed a bit.
- Metadata support added. Download the metadata from the releases below and extract the zip file to the root of your SD card. This adds game titles and box art to the menu. The screensaver also uses box art images.
- Support for [Adafruit Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6200). This version keeps the monitor at a 60 Hz refresh rate and should work on every monitor. The Fruit Jam has a built-in speaker and a NeoPixel LED strip that can be used as a VU meter.
- [Pimoroni Pico Plus 2](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-plus-2?variant=42092668289107) support added.
- When PSRAM is available, roms are loaded from SD card to PSRAM instead of flash. This speads the loading time up a lot.

## Fixes

- When SD card is prepared on MacOs, the metadata created by MacOs is now ignored. (Hopefully, because I cannot test this myself) 
- several small fixes and improvements.

# v0.5 release notes (this is a re-release)

- Releases now built with SDK 2.1.1
- Support added for Adafruit Metro RP2350 board. See README for more info. No RISCV support yet.
- Switched to SD card driver pico_fatfs from https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs. This is required for the Adafruit Metro RP2350. Thanks to [elehobica](https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs) for helping making it work for the Pimoroni Pico DV Demo board.
- Besides FAT32, SD cards can now also be formatted as exFAT.
- Nes controller PIO code updated by [@ManCloud](https://github.com/ManCloud). This fixes the NES controller issues on the Waveshare RP2040 - PiZero board. [#8](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico_shared/issues/8)
- Board configs are moved to pico_shared.

## Fixes
- Fixed Pico 2 W: Led blinking causes screen flicker and ioctl timeouts [#2](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico_shared/issues/2). Solved with in SDK 2.1.1
- WII classic controller: i2c bus instance (i2c0 / i2c1) not hardcoded anymore but configurable via CMakeLists.txt. 

## Features
- Releases now built with SDK 2.1.1
- Support added for Adafruit Metro RP2350 board. See README for more info. No RISCV support yet.
- Switched to SD card driver pico_fatfs https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs. This is required for the Adafruit Metro RP2350. The Pimoroni Pico DV does not work with this updated version and still needs the old version. (see [https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs/issues/7#issuecomment-2817953143](https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs/issues/7#issuecomment-2817953143) ) Therefore, the old version is still included in the repository. (pico_shared/drivers/pio_fatfs) 
    This is configured in CMakeLists.txt file by setting USE_OLD_SDDRIVER to 1.
- Besides FAT32, SD cards can now also be formatted as exFAT.
- Nes controller PIO code updated by [@ManCloud](https://github.com/ManCloud). This fixes the NES controller issues on the Waveshare RP2040 - PiZero board. [#8](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico_shared/issues/8)

## Fixes
- Fixed Pico 2 W: Led blinking causes screen flicker and ioctl timeouts [#2](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico_shared/issues/2). Solved with in SDK 2.1.1
- WII classic controller: i2c bus instance (i2c0 / i2c1) not hardcoded anymore but configurable via CMakeLists.txt.

> [!NOTE]
> On Pico W and Pico2 W, the CYW43 driver (used only for blinking the onboard LED) causes a DMA conflict with I2S audio on the Pimoroni Pico DV Demo Base, leading to emulator lock-ups. For now, no Pico W or Pico2 W binaries are provided; please use the Pico or Pico2 binaries instead.
