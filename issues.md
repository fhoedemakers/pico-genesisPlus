# Issues

- Waveshare RP2350-PiZero: cannot handle the higher clock frequency at all â€” the image keeps dropping out. At 252 MHz it works fine.
- WaveShare RP2350Zero: oes display an image and shows the menu without issues, but when starting a ROM the emulator crashes after a few seconds, usually right after the intro screen. Hopefully this is just a software bug I can fix.
